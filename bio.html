                    Every Sunday I go to church for my prayers. I love outing, touring and adventuring. I have travelled to many paces across Uganda, these include some; One Love Beach Busabala, Victoria Lake and many more.                    </p>

                    <p class="statements">My <strong>home town</strong> is Kawanda, Kamapala district. I love this place so much because my family is settling here. My family is not willing to transfer from Kawanda right now. This place is perfect
                    for our stay. We are next to town, so things are always simple and cheap to purchase. With this we are not willing to transfer right now.
                    I love my family so much. I give my siblings time and care for them a lot.

I love all of my loved ones most especially my <strong>mother</strong>, I love her the most with my relatives follwing and then my friends. A great hug to all of those friends at Namirembe Hill side secondary who have supported me when at school, and those friends(OGs and OBs) who supported me at primary level. But all in all, I thank the Lord Almghty God for blessing me with my sweet caring family. I pray that my family stays together and
                    never to depart in Christ I've prayed, Amen.

I can't believe I tend to stay on media platforms such as <strong>Instagram</strong> and <strong>WhatsApp</strong>. All these keep me awake, but because of the Lord's grace I manage to control myself and go to sleep, Amen.</p>

                    <p class="statements">Games to my side, I like simple games such as smart phone games. And I play responsibly because I have to spare some time for doing home chores. I spare less time in games most of the time in travelling, touring, praying to God. I put God first in everything I do because he has been here for me since my childhood up to date. Amen</p>

                        Always my heart is filled with fun and joy when with my family and God, I am next to my Lord always.
                        Those are my fun areas. And without my family, I can't have fun and happiness. <br> It's believed that fun begins with someone but mine begins with my family and God. Amen

                        I am selective at the music I choose to listen to all times, and this has helped me stay focussed to the Lord God our Almighty.
